**About**

This repository contains a Node.js Discord bot with modular commands, events and structures. It's organized into folders such as `commands/`, `events/`, `models/`, and `structures/` to keep features separated and maintainable.

**Contents (high level)**

- `commands/` - all bot command modules grouped by category
- `events/` - event handlers for Discord events
- `models/` - data models used by the bot
- `structures/` - helper classes and utilities

---

**Install & Run (quick)**

1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended).
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Configure `config.json` with your bot token and settings.

4. Run the bot:

```powershell
node shards.js
```

Below are two options you can use depending on where you want to show the widget.

- GitHub-friendly badge (clickable):

[![Join our Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join%20Server-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/zMxCnc29Zm)

- Website embed (copy into a web page). Replace `GUILD_ID` with your server ID if you prefer the official widget. Note: GitHub README does not allow iframes; use the following on an actual website:

```html
<!-- Discord widget (website use) -->
<iframe src="https://discord.com/widget?id=GUILD_ID&theme=dark" width="350" height="500" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>
```

If you don't know your `GUILD_ID`, the invite link above will still let people join.
